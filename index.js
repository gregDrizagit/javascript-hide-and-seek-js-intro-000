  //Define a function `deepestChild()` that pulls out the most deeply nested child
  //from `div#grand-node`. (Remember, you can iterate over elements and call
  //`querySelector()` and `querySelectorAll()` on them. This is challenging to
  //implement correctly, but not beyond your ability!)

  //Your solution for `deepestChild()` does not need to be totally
  //generic; we don't expect it to work in every case. For example, we know that
  //`div#grand-node` has only one node at each level â€” for this lab, you can solve
  //for that case, and not worry about a case where there are sibling nodes.

  //**HINT**: Remember learning about breadth-first search? A similar technique
  //might come in handy here.
